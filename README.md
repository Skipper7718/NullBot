# NullBot Mark 1
## About
---
This is a modifiable AI robot project using a Jetson Nano at its core. It is designed to be easy to build (it just snaps together with no glue required) and easy to modify. This can be done with modules, which connect to a shared bus system and can be accessed very easily. Everything except the base is considered a module. The tires in the images also are a module. The robot features easy camera control and an AI-stack, which makes it easy to use many neural nets on the bot.

## Features
* Jetson Nano as a core for stable control and AI capabilities.
* ESP-32 coprocessor to handle the module bus and other parts of the bot.
* Wifi antenna
* Infrared camera
* Big battery
